# # Fuzzy controller example in Python -- the Tipping Problem:
#
#
# In this notebook, you will see an example of a fuzzy controller for the "Tipping Problem" (from the [skfuzz documentation](https://scikit-fuzzy.github.io/scikit-fuzzy/auto_examples/plot_tipping_problem_newapi.html)):
#
# _Letâ€™s create a fuzzy control system which models how you might choose to tip at a restaurant. When tipping, you consider the service and food quality, rated between 0 and 10. You use this to leave a tip of between 0 and 25%._ .
#
# We will use an existing fuzzy control package for Python, ```skfuzz```.
#
# [ Documentation for skfuzz ](https://scikit-fuzzy.github.io/scikit-fuzzy/) (_note_: the documentation is not always perfect or completely up to date, but you can use the ```help(...)``` function in a code cell below to learn more about functions and arguments.)
#
#

# %% [markdown]
# First, we will install ```skfuzz``` (you should get version 0.4.2 or newer):

# %%
# ! pip install scikit-fuzzy

# %% [markdown]
# ## Inputs and outputs
#
# Below, we define the inputs and outputs for the fuzzy controller.
#
# Note that we use ```arange()``` from the ```numpy``` (or NumPy) library. ```arange()``` returns evenly spaced values within a given interval. The ```numpy``` library is a very widely used third-party library.
#

#

# %%
import numpy as np
import skfuzzy as fuzz
from skfuzzy import control as ctrl

# New Antecedent/Consequent objects hold universe variables and membership
# functions
quality = ctrl.Antecedent(np.arange(0, 11, 1), "quality")
service = ctrl.Antecedent(np.arange(0, 11, 1), "service")
tip = ctrl.Consequent(np.arange(0, 26, 1), "tip")

#  Membership functions for quality:
quality["poor"] = fuzz.trimf(quality.universe, [0, 0, 5])
quality["average"] = fuzz.trimf(quality.universe, [2, 5, 8])
quality["good"] = fuzz.trimf(quality.universe, [5, 10, 10])

#  Membership functions for service:
service["poor"] = fuzz.trimf(service.universe, [0, 0, 5])
service["average"] = fuzz.trimf(service.universe, [0, 5, 10])
service["good"] = fuzz.trimf(service.universe, [5, 10, 10])

# Membership functions for tip:
tip["low"] = fuzz.trimf(tip.universe, [0, 0, 13])
tip["medium"] = fuzz.trimf(tip.universe, [0, 13, 25])
tip["high"] = fuzz.trimf(tip.universe, [13, 25, 25])


# %% [markdown]
# We can now view the antecedents and the consequent:

# %%
quality.view()

# %%
service.view()

# %%
tip.view()

# %% [markdown]
# ## Fuzzy rules
#
# Now, to make these triangles useful, we define the *fuzzy relationship*
# between input and output variables. For the purposes of our example, consider
# three simple rules:
#
# 1. If the food is poor OR the service is poor, then the tip will be low
# 2. If the service is average, then the tip will be medium
# 3. If the food is good OR the service is good, then the tip will be high.
#
# Most people would agree on these rules, but the rules are fuzzy. Mapping the
# imprecise rules into a defined, actionable tip is a challenge. This is the
# kind of task at which fuzzy logic excels.

# %%
rule1 = ctrl.Rule(quality["poor"] | service["poor"], tip["low"])
rule2 = ctrl.Rule(service["average"], tip["medium"])
rule3 = ctrl.Rule(service["good"] | quality["good"], tip["high"])


# %% [markdown]
# ## Control System Creation and Simulation
#
# Now that we have our rules defined, we can simply create a control system
# via:

# %%
tipping_ctrl = ctrl.ControlSystem([rule1, rule2, rule3])

# %% [markdown]
# In order to simulate this control system, we will create a
# ``ControlSystemSimulation``.  Think of this object representing our controller
# applied to a specific set of cirucmstances.  For tipping, this might be tipping
# Sharon at the local brew-pub.  We would create another
# ``ControlSystemSimulation`` when we're trying to apply our ``tipping_ctrl``
# for Travis at the cafe because the inputs would be different.
#

# %%
tipping_sim = ctrl.ControlSystemSimulation(tipping_ctrl)


# %% [markdown]
# We can now simulate our control system by simply specifying the inputs
# and calling the ``compute`` method.  Suppose we rated the quality 6.5 out of 10
# and the service 9.8 of 10.

# %%
# Pass inputs to the ControlSystem using Antecedent labels with Pythonic API
# Note: if you like passing many inputs all at once, use .inputs(dict_of_data)
tipping_sim.input["quality"] = 6.5
tipping_sim.input["service"] = 9.8

# Crunch the numbers
tipping_sim.compute()


# %% [markdown]
# Once computed, we can view the result as well as visualize it.
#

# %%
# We round the input down to the nearest int:
print("We should tip {}%".format(int(tipping_sim.output["tip"])))
tip.view(sim=tipping_sim)


# %% [markdown]
# ## Notes
#
# Try to play with the above example:
# * Change the input values in a for-loop and print the results
# * Change the membership functions of the inputs and outputs, both their shapes and their definitions
# * Try to find out how to change the defuzzification method (it may involve some searching online)
