# # Monte Carlo approaches to prediction and control
#
# In this notebook, you will implement the Monte Carlo approaches to prediction and control described in [Sutton and Barto's book, Introduction to Reinforcement Learning](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html). We will use the grid ```World``` class from the previous lecture, but now without relying on knowledge of the task dynamics, that is, without relying on knowledge about transition probabilities.

# ### ```World``` class and globals
#
# The ```World``` is a grid represented as a two-dimensional array of characters where each character can represent free space, an obstacle, or a terminal. Each non-obstacle cell is associated with a reward that an agent gets for moving to that cell (can be 0). The size of the world is _width_ $\times$ _height_ characters.
#
# A _state_ is a tuple $(x,y)$.
#
# An empty world is created in the ```__init__``` method. Obstacles, rewards and terminals can then be added with ```add_obstacle``` and ```add_reward```.
#
# To calculate the next state of an agent (that is, an agent is in some state $s = (x,y)$ and performs and action, $a$), ```get_next_state()```should be called.
#
# __Note that ```get_state_transition_probabilities``` has been removed and an agent must now rely on experience interacting with a world to learn.__

# ## Basic example: Generating episodes
#
# An episode is the series of states, actions and rewards reflecting an agent's experience interacting with the environment. An episode starts with an agent being placed at some initial state and continues till the agent reaches a terminal state.  To generate episodes, we first need a world and a policy:
#

# %% colab={"base_uri": "https://localhost:8080/"}
world = World(2, 3)

# Since we only focus on episodic tasks, we must have a terminal state that the
# agent eventually reaches
world.add_terminal(1, 2, "+")


def equiprobable_random_policy(x, y):
    return {k: 1 / len(ACTIONS) for k in ACTIONS}


print(world.grid.T)


# %% [markdown]
# To generate an episode, we need to provide a ```World```, a policy, and a start state.
#
# In each step, we do the following:
# 1. perform one of the actions (weighted random) returned by the policy for the giving state
# 2. get the reward and add a new entry to the episode $[S_t, A_t, R_{t+1}]$
# 3. move the agent to the next state
#
# When a terminal state is reached, we return all the $[[S_0, A_0, R_1], ..., [S_{T}, A_T, R_{T+1}]]$ observed in the episode.


# %%
def generate_episode(world: World, policy, start_state):
    current_state = start_state
    episode = []
    while not world.is_terminal(*current_state):
        # Get the possible actions and their probabilities that our policy says
        # that the agent should perform in the current state:
        possible_actions = policy(*current_state)

        # Pick a weighted random action:
        action = random.choices(
            population=list(possible_actions.keys()),
            weights=possible_actions.values(),
            k=1,
        )

        # Get the next state from the world
        next_state = world.get_next_state(current_state, action[0])

        # Get the reward for performing the action
        reward = world.get_reward(*next_state)

        # Save the state, action and reward for this time step in our episode
        episode.append([current_state, action[0], reward])

        # Move the agent to the new state
        current_state = next_state

    return episode


# %% [markdown]
# Now, we can try to generate a couple of episodes and print the result:

# %% colab={"base_uri": "https://localhost:8080/"}
for i in range(5):
    print(f"Episode {i}:")
    episode = generate_episode(world, equiprobable_random_policy, (0, 0))
    print(pd.DataFrame(episode, columns=["State", "Action", "Reward"]), end="\n\n")

#
# There is one more step that has to be in place before we can start to optimize a policy: estimating state-action values, $q_\pi(s,a)$, based on experience. Above where we estimated $v_\pi$, we only needed to keep track of the average return observed for _each state_. However, in order to estimate state-action values, we need to compute the average return observed for _each state-action_ pair.
#
# That is, for every state $(0,0), (0,1), (0,2)...$ we need to compute different estimates for the four actions ```[ "up", "down", "left", "right" ]```

# ### Exercise: Implement on-policy Monte Carlo-based control with an $\epsilon$-soft policy
#
# You are now ready to implement MC-based control (see page 101 of [Introduction to Reinforcement Learning](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html) for the algorithm).
#
# In your implementation, you need to update the state-action estimates like in the exercise above, but now, you also need implement an $Ïµ$-soft policy that you can modify. How could you do that?
#
# _Hint_: You can either represent your policy explicitly. That is, for each state $(x,y)$ you have a ```dict``` with actions and their probabilities which you then update each time you step through an episode. When the policy is called, it then just returns the ```dict``` with action probablities corresponding to the current state.
#
# Alternatively, you can compute the action probabilities when your policy is called based on the current action-values estimates.
